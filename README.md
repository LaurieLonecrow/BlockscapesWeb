# BlockscapesWeb
I am currently building this basic site for a friend's landscaping/hardscaping company. https://laurielonecrow.github.io/BlockscapesWeb/  The site is shown here using the index.html file, css/js files.  I am also coding a separate version for practice using EJS templating, node.js, and Express, which I will link to here once I deploy it using Heroku.  In addition, I have published through wordpress, so that the client may have an active version while I continue my coding practices here.  That site can be viewed at www.blockscapesrva.com.
