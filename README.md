# BlockscapesWeb
I am currently building this basic site for a friend's landscaping/hardscaping company. https://laurielonecrow.github.io/BlockscapesWeb/  The site is shown here using the index.html file, css/js files.  In addition, I have published through wordpress, so that the client may have an active version while I continue my coding practices here.  That site can be viewed at www.blockscapesrva.com.
