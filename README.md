# BlockscapesWeb
I am currently building this basic site for a friend's landscaping/hardscaping  company. https://laurielonecrow.github.io/BlockscapesWeb/  The site is shown here using the index.html file.  I am also coding a separate site using EJS templating, node.js, and Express, which I will link to here once I deploy it using Heroku.
