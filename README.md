# Blockscapes 
This is a site for a friend's landscaping/hardscaping company.

## Tech Stack
The site uses EJS Templating with Express/Node.js framework.  

## Check it out!
This site is shown here https://laurielonecrow.github.io/BlockscapesWeb/.  In addition, I have built another site using Wordpress, so that the client may have an active version while I continue my coding practices here.  That site can be viewed at www.blockscapesrva.com.
