# BlockscapesWeb
This is a basic site for a friend's landscaping/hardscaping company using EJS Templating with Express/Node.js framework.  The site is shown here https://laurielonecrow.github.io/BlockscapesWeb/.  In addition, I have built another site using Wordpress, so that the client may have an active version while I continue my coding practices here.  That site can be viewed at www.blockscapesrva.com.
